# CSAS Transparent accounts

Repository with test task for CSAS interview.

Task was to focus on whatever is important for me, this is why it uses features appropriate for larger projects:
- uses [Tuist](https://tuist.io) for Xcode project generation - that's why repository contains no project file
- uses modularization - good for large projects, absurd for such small project as this
- is testable with just a few snapshot tests, more tests could be added

To generate Xcode project, it is necessary to install [Tuist](https://tuist.io) and run `tuist generate`. I created [archived version](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/079M_ItY_nz1b0f1-IWZfG1-A#csas-transparent-accounts) of the project so Tuist installation can be skipped.
